  <h3>Page not found</h3>
 <p id="text1"> Well, this is awkward... It seems our Banu Merchantman has gone missing! Last seen somewhere between Crusader and Microtech, our beloved space whale was supposedly "just making a quick pit stop" at GrimHEX for some "totally legitimate business dealings." The crew swears they only went in for five minutes to grab some Big Benny's noodles, but that was three weeks ago. Security footage shows the ship's captain getting distracted by a shiny new multitool at Dumper's Depot, while the co-pilot was spotted arguing with a Drake Cutlass owner about cargo capacity in the hab ring. Meanwhile, their Merchantman appears to have wandered off like a lost puppy, probably following the scent of profitable trade routes. If you happen to spot a massive alien ship trying to squeeze through station airlocks or getting stuck in asteroid fields because someone forgot how big it actually is, please contact us immediately. Reward: One slightly used Aurora MR and our eternal gratitude. The page you're looking for is probably in the cargo hold somewhere, but good luck finding it in that labyrinth! </p>
  <p id="text2"> **Error 404: Cargo Not Found**

It seems our Banu Merchantman has done what it does best—disappeared into the void with your requested page aboard! Last spotted three systems over, our alien merchant friends were supposedly delivering your content along with a cargo hold full of "rare artifacts" (probably just repackaged Aurora parts). Unfortunately, the crew got distracted by a particularly lucrative trade route involving Xi'an tea and Tevarin scrap metal. They're probably haggling over profit margins in some distant asteroid field while your page floats helplessly in their cargo bay. Don't worry though—knowing Banu merchants, they'll be back eventually... once they've squeezed every last UEC out of their current deal. In the meantime, perhaps try navigating back to known space, or check if you typed the coordinates correctly. The 'verse is vast, but not even a Banu can stay lost forever!</p>
  <p id="text3"> **Error 404: Page Lost in Translation**

Oops! Looks like our Banu Merchantman crew tried to translate your requested page into proper Banu script, but something got lost in the process. You know how it is with alien languages—one wrong syllable and suddenly "homepage" becomes "exotic spice shipment" in their database. The ship's AI is currently stuck in an endless loop trying to convert your URL into profitable trade goods, while the Banu captain keeps insisting that what you're really looking for is a premium selection of aged cheeses from Goss. Their translation software was last updated sometime during the Messer Era, so we're not holding our breath for a quick fix. Maybe try speaking slower next time, or just wave some credits around—that's universal language the Banu understand perfectly! </p>
   <p id="text4"> **Error 404: Merchantman Currently Docked for "Routine Maintenance"**

Well, this is embarrassing. Our Banu Merchantman containing your page has been "temporarily" docked at Port Olisar for what the crew calls "routine maintenance." We suspect they're actually just hiding from some very unhappy customers who discovered that their "authentic Vanduul artifacts" were actually painted PVC pipes from a Terra construction site. The ship's been sealed tighter than a vacuum suit, with the captain claiming they need to "recalibrate the quantum drive" (which is Banu-speak for "waiting for the heat to die down"). Security footage shows crew members sneaking off the ship with suspiciously heavy duffel bags, so your page might have been... redistributed as collateral. Don't worry though—once they finish laundering their reputation through a few legitimate salvage runs, they'll be back to deliver your content. Probably. </p>
 <p id="text5"> **Error 404: Quantum Jump Miscalculation**

Austin, we have a problem! Our Banu Merchantman attempted a quantum jump to deliver your page, but their navigation computer was running black market firmware from some sketchy dealer in Grim Hex. Instead of arriving at your coordinates, they've somehow ended up in a completely different dimension where everything is measured in Quasar units and the local currency is apparently "shiny rocks." The crew is currently trying to convince interdimensional customs that your missing webpage constitutes "legitimate trade cargo" and not "random human nonsense." Their last transmission was something about needing to bribe a cosmic entity with fermented fruit to get clearance for a return jump. The good news? They've discovered a lucrative market for Earth memes in dimension X-7. The bad news? Your page is now being used as legal tender in an alien stock exchange. We'll get it back... eventually... maybe... </p>
